# AWS API client for AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
This is the <i>Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority (PCA) API
Reference</i>. It provides descriptions, syntax, and usage examples for each
of the actions and data types involved in creating and managing a private
certificate authority (CA) for your organization.

The documentation for each action shows the API request parameters and the
JSON response. Alternatively, you can use one of the Amazon Web Services
SDKs to access an API that is tailored to the programming language or
platform that you prefer. For more information, see <a
href="https://aws.amazon.com/tools/#SDKs">Amazon Web Services SDKs</a>.

Each ACM Private CA API operation has a quota that determines the number of
times the operation can be called per second. ACM Private CA throttles API
requests at different rates depending on the operation. Throttling means
that ACM Private CA rejects an otherwise valid request because the request
exceeds the operation's quota for the number of requests per second. When a
request is throttled, ACM Private CA returns a <a
href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/acm-pca/latest/APIReference/CommonErrors.html">ThrottlingException</a>
error. ACM Private CA does not guarantee a minimum request rate for APIs.

To see an up-to-date list of your ACM Private CA quotas, or to request a
quota increase, log into your Amazon Web Services account and visit the <a
href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/">Service Quotas</a>
console.
