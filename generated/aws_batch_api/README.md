# AWS API client for AWS Batch

**Generated Dart library from API specification**

*About the service:*
Using Batch, you can run batch computing workloads on the Amazon Web
Services Cloud. Batch computing is a common means for developers,
scientists, and engineers to access large amounts of compute resources.
Batch uses the advantages of this computing workload to remove the
undifferentiated heavy lifting of configuring and managing required
infrastructure. At the same time, it also adopts a familiar batch computing
software approach. Given these advantages, Batch can help you to efficiently
provision resources in response to jobs submitted, thus effectively helping
you to eliminate capacity constraints, reduce compute costs, and deliver
your results more quickly.
